** Description
   A RESTful API built with Java Spring Boot that enables searching for a radio show available on SR's public API.
   
   Accepts a =GET= request with search query at ={ApplicationUrl}/search?{query}= and server the user one of:
   
   #+NAME: show-found
   #+BEGIN_SRC json
      HttpStatus = 200
      {
         "message" : "The following show matched the search term <query>:",
         "name" : "<show name>",
         "description" : "<show> description>",
         "broadcastinfo" : "<show broadcastinfo>"
      }
   #+END_SRC

   #+NAME: show-not-found
   #+BEGIN_SRC json
      HttpStatus = 404
      {
         "message" : "No results found - Try a different search term",
         "name" : null,
         "description" : null,
         "broadcastinfo" : null
      }
   #+END_SRC

   
** Run Project
   1. Clone the project, =$ git clone https://github.com/ThonyPrice/SR-Show-Finder.git=
   2. Change directory, =cd SR-API/rest-service=
   3. Run, =./mvnw spring-boot:run=

   The application should now serve the API on [[http://localhost:8080]]. If not, check output for what port was available.
   You can now test the API by browsing [[http://localhost:8080/search?name={your-search-term}]].

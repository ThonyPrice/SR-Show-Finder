* Search for SR Radio Shows

[[./img/swagger-screenshot.png]]

** Description
   A RESTful API built with Java Spring Boot that enables searching for a radio show available on SR's public API.
   Implements Swagger for testing through GUI.
   
   Accepts a =GET= request with search query at ={ApplicationUrl}/api/search?name={query}= and server the user one of:
   
   #+NAME: show-found
   #+BEGIN_SRC json
      HttpStatus = 200
      {
         "message" : "The following show matched the search term <query>:",
         "name" : "<show name>",
         "description" : "<show> description>",
         "broadcastinfo" : "<show broadcastinfo>"
      }
   #+END_SRC

   #+NAME: show-not-found
   #+BEGIN_SRC json
      HttpStatus = 404
      {
         "message" : "No results found - Try a different search term",
         "name" : null,
         "description" : null,
         "broadcastinfo" : null
      }
   #+END_SRC

   
** Run Project
   1. Clone the project, =$ git clone https://github.com/ThonyPrice/SR-Show-Finder.git=
   2. Change directory, =$ cd SR-API/rest-service=
   3. Run, =$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run=

   The application should now serve the API on [[http://localhost:8080/api/search]]. If not, check output for what port was available.
   You can now test the API using Swagger by browsing to [[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html]].
      
*** Project Dependencies
    - The data is fetched from SR's public API, hence dependent on it being up. Find its documentation at https://sverigesradio.se/api/documentation/v2/index.html.
    - Local instance of Java, see [[https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html#linux][installation docs]]. The development is made through [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Java#OpenJDK][OpenJDK]].
     
*** Project Tests
    Test are located in =src/test/java/com/example/restservice=. 
    Run them from root directory: =$ ./mvnw test=
    
** Limitations
   - No verification of SR's API response.
   - No tests.
   - No deployment wrapper like Docker.
   - Minimal exception handling.
